# README

Quick UI for Cinder.
Sister project of https://github.com/dimitre/ofxDmtrUI  
Dimitre, http://dmtr.org/  

## Ideas
Build a radio with multiple values possible.
It builds a vector <string> of results with variable dimensions, you can iterate and grab OK items. Really nice to make some text flowing booleans.

Updates inside a Bus with wifi, from Caçapava do Sul to Porto Alegre. SliderInt, Label working, soon toggle working too.
330 lines of code.  
In fact I’m testing some nice ideas I had *after* building ofxDmtrUI.
